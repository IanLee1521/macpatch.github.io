MacPatch custom patch content is pretty simple to create. All content is created via the new content wizard. Keep in mind that there are only 4 required attributes which are required to create a patch. The 4 attributes are `Patch Name`, `Patch Version`, `Patch Group ID`, `Patch Package`.

## Create New Patch
Creating a new patch is broken down in to 4 steps. In this example we will be creating a patch for Firefox.

### Step 1

![Setp 1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.mediabase }}/{{ page.mediadir }}/Patch-Step1.png "Step 1")

`Patch Name`, and `Patch Version` are required fields. By default a new patch has it's patch state set to "Create". A patch will not show as needed to a client until it's state is at least set to "QA".

### Step 2

![Setp 2]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.mediabase }}/{{ page.mediadir }}/Patch-Step2.png "Step 2")

While none of the fields are required, adding patch detection criteria is highly recommended. In this example we have added two detection queries. The first one looks to see if the `/Applications/Firefox.app` exists. The second query looks to see if Firefox version is less than 30.0.0.

For a patch to become required all patch detection criteria queries need to return True. If any return false a patch is not needed.

### Step 3

![Setp 3]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.mediabase }}/{{ page.mediadir }}//Patch-Step3.png "Step 3")

`Patch Group ID`, and `Patch Package` are required fields.

In this example it's important to note that the `Patch Group ID` is in the form Reverse URL and similar to Bundle ID. While anything can be used as a `Patch Group ID`, bundle id's are suggested.

When uploading a patch a `*.pkg.zip` file is required at this time.

### Step 4

![Setp 4]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.mediabase }}/{{ page.mediadir }}/Patch-Step4.png "Step 4")

Here you can add pre & post requisite packages. Also, once the patch is created you will need to make it active. This can only be done once the initial patch has been created.

## Patch Criteria Language

Base Criteria | Query | Value | Query Result | Example
---|---|---|---|---
**BundleID** | Exists | BundleID | True/False | Exists@com.adobe.Reader@True
<span></span> | Version | BundleID | Version;(EQ,LT,LTE,GT,GTE,NEQ) | Version@com.adobe.Reader@9.3.0;LT

Base Criteria | Query | Value | Query Result | Example
---|---|---|---|---
**File** | Exists | File path | True/False | Exists@/Applications/Firefox.app@True
<span></span> | Date | File path | True/False | Date@/Applications/Firefox.app@2010-03-22 12:00:00;LT
<span></span> | Hash | File path | MD5 Hash;True/False | Hash@/Applications/Firefox.app@123432dsh2362h3h;TRUE
<span></span> | Version | File path | Version;(EQ,LT,LTE,GT,GTE,NEQ) | Version@/Applications/Firefox.app@3.5.7;LT

Base Criteria | Query | Value | Query Result | Example
---|---|---|---|---
**Script** | Script | Script | True | (NOTE: If a "@" is used it must be escaped with another "@")

### Testing Patch Content
To test patch content you will need to edit the client settings those clients deemed as QA clients. This is done by creating a new patch group with the "QA" type and editing the clients config plist.

Change PatchGroup

	defaults write /Library/Preferences/gov.llnl.mpagent.plist PatchGroup RecommendedPatchesQA
    
Allow QA Patches to be installed

	defaults write /Library/Preferences/gov.llnl.mpagent.plist PatchState All
