	<h1>MacPatch - Building the Client Agent</h1>

	<p><strong>Version 1.0 for MacPatch v2.5.x</strong></p>

	<p>The MacPatch client agent needs to be build on a Mac OS X system running Mac OS X 10.7 or higher. You will also need to upload the finished agent from a Mac OS X system using the "Agent Uploader.app".</p>

	<h2>Required Software</h2>

	<p>Xcode is the only required software to build the client agent.</p>

	<h3>Xcode</h3>

	<p>Xcode is required to build the MacPatch software for Mac OS X. While you can install the GUI version of Xcode and download and install the command line tools from within Xcode. You will be installing the Xcode command line tools from the Terminal.app.</p>

	<p><em>Test for Xcode</em><br>
	<strong>% xcode-select --version</strong><br>
	If you get back a version they are installed .</p>

	<p><em>Install Xcode</em><br>
	<strong>% xcode-select --install</strong></p>

	<h2>Download and build the agent</h2>

	<p>To download and build the MacPatch client agent software there are just a couple of Terminal commands to run.</p>

	<pre><code>• sudo mkdir -p /Library/MacPatch/tmp
	• cd /Library/MacPatch/tmp
	• sudo git clone https://github.com/SMSG-MAC-DEV/MacPatch.git
	• sudo /Library/MacPatch/tmp/MacPatch/scripts/MPBuildClient.sh
	</code></pre>

	<p>Once the compile and copy process is completed the finished client agent software can be found in "<strong>/Library/MacPatch/tmp/Client/Combined/MPClientInstall.pkg.zip</strong>"</p>

	<h4>Changing Agent Version Info</h4>

	<p>If you need to update the agent version because you have updated the MacPatch code or just want to test the client update feature you will need to update the "<strong>Library/MacPatch/tmp/MacPatch/MacPatch PKG/Combined/Resources/mpInfo.plist</strong>" file. The easiest way to do so is to increment the "<strong>build</strong>" number.</p>
