    <h1>Quick Start Guide for Mac OS X</h1>

    <p>This is a quick start guide to getting MacPatch installed and running on a Mac OS X based system. For the purpose of this guide we will be installing on a Mac OS X 10.9.x system.</p>

    <h2>Required Software</h2>

    <p>There are two prerequisites to installing the MacPatch server software. Java and Xcode command line tools need to be installed.</p>

    <h3>Java</h3>

    <p>Java can be downloaded from Oracle at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html. Java 7 (JDK) is recommended. Java 8 has not been tested at this time. Once the Java 7 JDK has been installed the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 7" are needed as well. These files can be found on the same location.</p>

    <h3>Xcode</h3>

    <p>Xcode is required to build the MacPatch software for Mac OS X. While you can install the GUI version of Xcode and download and install the command line tools from within Xcode. You will be installing the Xcode command line tools from the Terminal.app.</p>

    <p><em>Test for Xcode</em><br>
    <strong>% xcode-select --version</strong><br>
    If you get back a version they are installed .</p>

    <p><em>Install Xcode</em><br>
    <strong>% xcode-select --install</strong></p>

    <h3>PIP (Python Modules)</h3>

    <pre>sudo easy_install pip  # if you don't already have pip
sudo pip install requests
sudo pip install argparse
    </pre>

    <h2>Download and build the Server software</h2>

    <p>To download and build the MacPatch server software is just a few Terminal commands. Run the following commands to build and install the software.</p>

    <p>Please note, you will be asked if you want to use the Jetty J2EE server. With MacPatch 2.5 Tomcat is now the default J2EE server. The Jetty distribution is old and may have security vulnerabilities. It is scheduled to be removed in the next release.</p>

    <pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /Library/MacPatch/tmp
cd /Library/MacPatch/tmp
sudo git clone https://github.com/SMSG-MAC-DEV/MacPatch.git
sudo /Library/MacPatch/tmp/MacPatch/scripts/MPBuildServer.sh
    </code></pre>

    <p>Once the compile and copy process is completed, the MacPatch server software is now installed and ready to be configured.</p>

    <h2>MySQL Database</h2>

    <p>MacPatch requires the use of MySQL database. The database can be installed on the first server built or it can be installed on a separate host. MySQL version 5.5.x or higher is required. MySQL 5.6.x is recommended due to it's performance enhancements. Also, the MySQL InnoDB engine is required.</p>

    <h3>Configure MySQL Database</h3>

    <p>Run the following commands via the Terminal.app.</p>

    <p><strong>Log in as the MySQL root user</strong></p>

    <pre><code>mysql -u root -p
    </code></pre>

    <p><strong>Run the following MySQL commands</strong><br>
    <em>Replace the word "Password" with your own password.</em></p>

    <pre><code>mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE MacPatchDB;
mysql&gt; CREATE USER 'mpdbadm'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Password';
mysql&gt; GRANT ALL ON MacPatchDB.* TO 'mpdbadm'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Password';
mysql&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON MacPatchDB.* TO 'mpdbadm'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Password';
mysql&gt; CREATE USER 'mpdbro'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Password';
mysql&gt; GRANT SELECT ON MacPatchDB.* TO 'mpdbro'@'%';
mysql&gt; SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
mysql&gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    </code></pre>

    <p><strong>Delete MySQL anonymous accounts</strong></p>

    <pre><code>mysql&gt; DROP USER ''@'localhost';
mysql&gt; DROP USER ''@'host_name';
mysql&gt; quit
    </code></pre>

    <p><strong>Load Database Schema</strong></p>

    <p>The database schema files are located on the MacPatch server in the <strong>/Library/MacPatch/Server/conf/Database/</strong> directory. To load the tables and the views, copy the <strong>MacPatchDB_Tables.sql</strong> and <strong>MacPatchDB_Views.sql</strong> files to the Database host. The following commands are for a server that is also hosting the MacPatch database.</p>

    <pre><code>% mysql MacPatchDB -u mpdbadm -p &lt; /Library/MacPatch/Server/conf/Database/MacPatchDB_Tables.sql
% mysql MacPatchDB -u mpdbadm -p &lt; /Library/MacPatch/Server/conf/Database/MacPatchDB_Views.sql
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Setup MacPatch Server</h2>

    <p>The MacPatch server has five configuration script and should be run in the given order. The scripts are located on the server in <strong>/Library/MacPatch/Server/conf/scripts/Setup/</strong>.</p>

    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <tr>
            <th>Script</th>

    <h3>Download Content -</h3>

    <h5>Apple Updates</h5>

    <p>Apple patch content will download eventually on it's own cycle, but for the first time it's recommended to download it manually.</p>

    <p>Run the following command via the Terminal.app on the <em>Master</em> MacPatch server.</p>

    <pre><code>sudo -u _appserver /Library/MacPatch/Server/conf/scripts/MPSUSPatchSync.py --plist /Library/MacPatch/Server/conf/etc/gov.llnl.mp.patchloader.plist
    </code></pre>

    <h5>Symantec AntiVirus Defs</h5>

    <p>If you have elected to deploy Symantec AntiVirus definitions via MacPatch then it's also recommended that you download the content manually for the first time.</p>

    <pre><code> sudo -u _appserver /Library/MacPatch/Server/conf/scripts/MPAVDefsSync.py --plist /Library/MacPatch/Server/conf/etc/gov.llnl.mpavdl.plist
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Configure MacPatch - Admin Console</h2>

    <p>Now that the MacPatch server is up and running, you will need to configure the environment.</p>

    <h3>First Login</h3>

    <p>The default user name is "mpadmin" and the password is "*mpadmin*". You will need to login for the first time with this account to do all of the setup tasks. Once these tasks are completed it's recommended that this accounts password be changed. This can be done by editing the siteconfig.xml file, which is located in <em>/Library/MacPatch/Server/conf/etc/</em>.</p>

    <h3>Default Configuration</h3>

    <h5>MacPatch Server Info</h5>

    <p>Each MacPatch server need to be added to the environment. By default we will be adding the first server, the <em>Master</em> to the list.</p>
